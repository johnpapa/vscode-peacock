[![Badge for version for Visual Studio Code extension johnpapa.vscode-peacock](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/johnpapa.vscode-peacock.svg?color=blue&style=?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock&wt.mc_id=github-oss-jopapa)

A Visual Studio Code extension that subtly changes the workspace color of your workspace. Ideal when you have multiple VS Code instances and you want to quickly identify which is which.

## Install

1. Open **Extensions** sidebar panel in Visual Studio Code. `View â†’ Extensions`
1. Search for `Peacock`
1. Click **Install**
1. Click **Reload**, if required

## Features

Commands can be found in the command palette. Look for commands beginning with `Peacock:`

- Change the color of "affectedElements" (see `peacock.affectedElements` in the Properties section) to
  - user defined color
  - a random color
  - the primary color for angular, vue, or react
- Saves colors to your workspace in the `.vscode/settings.json` file
- Sets the foreground to light `#e7e7e7` and dark `#15202b` based on the contrast for the background color

## Properties

| Property                 | Description                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| peacock.affectedElements | prefixes of elements affected by peacock        |
| peacock.darkForeground   | override for the dark foreground                |
| peacock.lightForeground  | override for the light foreground               |
| peacock.preferredColors  | array of objects for color names and hex values |

### Preferred Colors

After setting 1 or more colors (hex or named) in the user setting for `peacock.preferredColors`, you can select `Peacock: Change to a Preferred Color` and you will be prompted with the list from `peacock.preferredColors` from user settings.

```text
Gatsby Purple -> #123456
Auth0 Orange -> #eb5424
Azure Blue -> #007fff
```

Preferred colors require a user-defined name (`name`) and a value ( `value` ), as shown in the example below.

```javascript
  "peacock.preferredColors": [
    { "name": "Gatsby Purple", "value": "#639" },
    { "name": "Auth0 Orange", "value": "#eb5424" },
    { "name": "Azure Blue", "value": "#007fff" }
  ]
```

### Affected Elements

You can tell peacock which parts of VS Code will be affected by when you select a color. You can do this by checking the appropriate setting that applies to the elements you want to be colored. The choices are:
