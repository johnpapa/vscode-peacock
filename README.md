# Peacock, for Visual Studio Code

[![Badge for version for Visual Studio Code extension johnpapa.vscode-peacock](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/johnpapa.vscode-peacock.svg?color=blue&style=?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock&wt.mc_id=github-oss-jopapa)

A Visual Studio Code extension that subtly changes the workspace color of your workspace. Ideal when you have multiple VS Code instances and you want to quickly identify which is which.

## Install

1. Open **Extensions** sidebar panel in Visual Studio Code. `View â†’ Extensions`
1. Search for `Peacock`
1. Click **Install**
1. Click **Reload**, if required

## Features

Commands can be found in the command palette. Look for commands beginning with `Peacock:`

- Change the color of [Affected Elements](#Affected-Elements) (see `peacock.affectedElements` in the Properties section) to
  - [user defined color](#Input-Formats)
  - a random color
  - the primary color for angular, vue, or react
- Set and select a user-defined color with the [Preferred Color](#Preferred-Colors) feature
- [Adjust the coloring of affected elements](#Element-Adjustments) by making them slightly darker or lighter to provide a subtle visual contrast between them
- Saves colors to your workspace in the `.vscode/settings.json` file

## Settings

| Property                   | Description                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| peacock.affectActivityBar  | Specifies whether Peacock should affect the activity bar                                              |
| peacock.affectStatusBar    | Specifies whether Peacock should affect the status bar                                                |
| peacock.affectTitleBar     | Specifies whether Peacock should affect the title bar (see [title bar coloring](#title-bar-coloring)) |
| peacock.elementAdjustments | fine tune coloring of affected elements                                                               |
| peacock.preferredColors    | array of objects for color names and hex values                                                       |

### Preferred Colors

After setting 1 or more colors (hex or named) in the user setting for `peacock.preferredColors`, you can select `Peacock: Change to a Preferred Color` and you will be prompted with the list from `peacock.preferredColors` from user settings.

```text
Gatsby Purple -> #123456
Auth0 Orange -> #eb5424
Azure Blue -> #007fff
```

Preferred colors require a user-defined name (`name`) and a value ( `value` ), as shown in the example below.

```javascript
  "peacock.preferredColors": [
    { "name": "Gatsby Purple", "value": "#639" },
    { "name": "Auth0 Orange", "value": "#eb5424" },
    { "name": "Azure Blue", "value": "#007fff" }
  ]
```

### Affected Elements

You can tell peacock which parts of VS Code will be affected by when you select a color. You can do this by checking the appropriate setting that applies to the elements you want to be colored. The choices are:

#### Title Bar Coloring

The VS Code Title Bar style can be configured to be custom or native with the `window.titleBarStyle` setting. When operating in native mode, Peacock is unable to colorize the Title Bar because VS Code defers Title Bar management to the OS. In order to leverage the Affect Title Bar setting to colorize the Title Bar, the `window.titleBarStyle` must be set to custom.

On macOS there are additional settings that can impact the Title Bar style and force it into native mode regardless of the `window.titleBarStyle` setting. These include:

* `window.nativeTabs` should be set to **false**. If using native tabs, the rendering of the title bar is deferred to the OS and native mode is forced.
* `window.nativeFullScreen` should be set to **true**. If not using native full screen mode, the custom title bar rendering presents issues in the OS and native mode is forced.

A successful and recommended settings configuration to colorize the Title Bar is:

### Element Adjustments

You can fine tune the coloring of affected elements by making them slightly darker or lighter to provide a subtle visual contrast between them. Options for adjusting elements are:

- `"darken"`: reduces the value of the selected color to make it slightly darker
- `"lighten"`: increases the value of the selected color to make it slightly lighter
- `"none"`: no adjustment will be made to the selected color

An example of using this might be to make the Activity Bar slightly lighter than the Status Bar and Title Bar to better visually distinguish it as present in several popular themes. This can be achieved with the setting in the example below.

```javascript
  "peacock.affectActivityBar": true,
  "peacock.affectStatusBar": true,
  "peacock.affectTitleBar": true,
  "peacock.elementAdjustments": {
    "activityBar": "lighten"
  }
```

When using peacock with the Angular Red color, this results in the Activity Bar being slightly lighter than the Status Bar and Title Bar (see below).

| RGB               | rgb (136, 187, 34), rgb 255 0 0                  |
| RGBA              | rgba (136, 187, 34, .8), rgba 255 0 0 .8         |
| HSL               | hsl (80, 69%, 43%), hsl (0 1 .5)                 |
| HSLA              | hsla (80, 69%, 43%, 0.8), hsla (0 1 .5 .8)       |
| HSV               | hsv (80, 82%, 73%), hsv (0 1 1)                  |

All formats offer flexible data validation:

- For named HTML colors, case is insensitive
- For any hex value, the `#` is optional.
- For any color formula value all parentheses and commas are optional and any number can be a decimal or percentage (with the exception of the alpha channel in rgba(), hsla(), and hsva() which must be a decimal between 0 and 1).
