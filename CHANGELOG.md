# Change Log

All notable changes to the code will be documented in this file.

## 0.6.0

Features

- New setting for `peacock.elementAdjustments` that allows for slight value adjustments of affected elements to visually distinguish them from one another.
- Activity Bar icons now reflect current active state with the current activity in the foreground color and inactive activities indicated.
- Color entry now supports a larger variety of formats with more flexible entry restrictions (see [input formats](./README.md#input-formats) in [README](./README.md) for more information)

Other Changes

- Removed settings for dark and light foregrounds. Now defaults to DarkForeground = '15202b' and LightForeground = 'e7e7e7'. The value of these felt low vs the overhead of yet another setting
- Introduced the [tinycolor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinycolor2) library to handle color input validation, color conversion, and color manipulation
- Refactored much of the internal color library
- Added several unit tests for color input entry, affected elements, and element adjustments
- Updated README

## 0.5.0

Breaking Changes

Instead of an array, there are three separate configuration properties for the affected element settings:

```json
    "configuration": {
      "properties": {
        "peacock.affectTitleBar": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "default": true,
          "description": "Specifies whether Peacock should affect the title bar."
        },
        "peacock.affectActivityBar": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "default": false,
          "description": "Specifies whether Peacock should affect the activity bar."
        },
        "peacock.affectStatusBar": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "default": false,
          "description": "Specifies whether Peacock should affect the status bar."
        }
      }
    }
```

Other changes

- Refactored the constants, enums, and interfaces into a `models` folder in the code with a barrel for access

## 0.4.0

Features

- Refactored Preferred Colors to display the user-defined name of a color and the color value in a quick pick list.

The preferred colors require a custom name (`name`) and a value ( `value` ), as shown in the example below. See the README.md for details.

```javascript
  "peacock.preferredColors": [
    { "name": "Gatsby Purple", "value": "#639" },
    { "name": "Auth0 Orange", "value": "#eb5424" },
    { "name": "Azure Blue", "value": "#007fff" }
  ]
