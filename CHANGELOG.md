# Change Log

All notable changes to the code will be documented in this file.

## 2.5.0

Features

- Peacock now detects when the [VS Code Remote](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension is installed and adds commands that allow the user to change color depending on the remote context (container, ssh, wsl).
  - added `Change Remote Color (SSH)` to commands. Prompts user to select a color for the SSH remote context from the Favorites
  - added `Change Remote Color (Containers)` to commands. Prompts user to select a color for the Containers remote context from the Favorites
  - added `Change Remote Color (WSL)` to commands. Prompts user to select a color for the WSL remote context from the Favorites
- added tests for remote features

## 2.4.0

Features

- added `Peacock: Darken` to the commands. Currently darkens the current color by the `darkenLightenPercentage` setting
- added `Peacock: Lighten` to the commands. Currently lightens the current color by the `darkenLightenPercentage` setting
- added `peacock.darkenLightenPercentage` to settings. Indicates the percentage to darken or lighten the color (defaults to 10%)
- added key bindings for lighten `alt+cmd+=` and for darken `alt+cmd+-`

Breaking Changes

- default values for new installations are to colorize all three affected areas: titleBar, activityBar, and statusBar. new users were sometimes confused why Peacock was only coloring the titlebar. While the settings are explained in the README, this should help people see the possibilities better.

Bug Fixes

- fixed broken test that added and removed an extra setting

## 2.3.0

Features

- Added _Go Cyan_ `#5dc9e2` to favorites for Go
- Changed to v 2.3.0 as a minor or major will add new favorites

Bug fixes

- fixes the issue when after canceling the ">Peacock: Change to a Favorite Color" command, the color of the workspace is set to black and adds the appropriate test.

## 2.2.2

Features

- Added [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) integration.
- Updated README for Live Share and Remote Development integrations
- added `Peacock: Change Live Share Color (Host)` to the commands
- added `Peacock: Change Live Share Color (Guest)` to the commands

## 2.1.2

Features

- Added _Java Blue-Gray_ `#557c9b` to favorites for Java
- Added "extensionKind": "ui"` to support remote development features in VS Code (see [#141](https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-peacock/pull/142/))

## 2.1.1

Features

- Added _C# Purple_ `#68217A` to favorites for .NET Core

## 2.1.0

Enhancements

- Extension as API: Added color parameter to enterColor handler which allow the developer to call the extension programmatically without prompting user input

## 2.0.1

Maintenance

- Refactored to remove a dependency on a testing file
- Removed `helpers` file, since I don't feel that was descriptive or helpful (pun intended)
  - Moved functions in that file to better existing modules

## 2.0.0

Features and Breaking Changes

- Added settings which allow the user to override the dark and light foreground colors
  - _darkForegroundColor_ setting (defaults to `15202b`) which can override the dark foreground on what is calculated as a light background
  - _lightForegroundColor_ setting (defaults to `e7e7e7`) which can override the light foreground on what is calculated as a dark background
- `Add recommended favorites` is now a command
- Recommended favorites are now being saved when a new version is installed. Avoid using the same names.
  - Recommended favorites are a list of constants found in `favorites.ts`. These are alphabetized.
  - Recommended favorites are a starting point for favorites. They will be installed whenever a new version is installed. They will extend your existing favorites, so feel free to continue to add to your local favorites! However be careful not to change the color of the recommended favorites as they will be overridden when a new version is installed.
  - This list may change from version to version depending on the Peacock authoring team.
- Built-in colors for Angular, React and Vue have been removed in favor of "favorites"
- One Built-in color exists: Peacock Green. This gives a user an easy color choice :)

## 1.3.1

Bug fixes

- fix issue where surprise me message shows up anytime a surprise me command is run.

## 1.3.0

Features

- _Surprise Me On Startup_: When enabled, Peacock will automatically apply a random color on startup when opening any workspace that does not already have color customizations defined. It will also show an information dialog in case the user forgot this setting is enabled.

Other Changes

- Added logging to an output channel for diagnostics
- Refactored internal state to be a static class, to make it easy to log when state changes
- Added [webpack bundling](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension)
- Fixed tests to wipe out the extra setting that was added during one test

## 1.2.1

Bug Fixes

- Resolved error for "command peacock.\* not found". Was due to a missing file and function for `isObjectEmpty`. The code was in the test folder and thus worked locally, in debug mode, and in CI for testing (which is why CI was green). This is now resolved bu moving the file and function to the `src` folder.

## 1.2.0

Features

- _Preview Your Favorite_: When opening the Favorites command in the command palette, Peacock now previews (applies) the color as you cycle through them. If you cancel (press ESC), your colors revert to what you had prior to trying the Favorites command

Bug Fixes

- When entering a color and canceling, or when entering an empty string, an error is no longer thrown

Other Changes

- When resetting colors, Peacock wasn't removing the old `workbench.colorCustomizations` if it was empty. It now does

## 1.1.0

Features

- Added Save current color as a favorite color
- When a setting is changed, Peacock should update the colors appropriately based on the most recently used color during the active VS Code instance's session

Breaking Changes

- Renamed commands and settings from 'preferred' to 'favorite'

## 1.0.0

Other Changes

- Added colorization of items in the status bar on hover to better fit with the color that Peacock applies.
- Added colorization of the Activity Bar badge based on the background color applied by Peacock to improve readability
- Refactored inactive element coloring to better match default behavior of VS Code and most themes.
- Added azure devops CI process to test on macos, linux and windows with Node 8 and 10

## 0.7.0

Features

- Added `peacock.keepForegroundColor` setting, which specifies whether Peacock should change affect colors (see [Keep Foreground Color](./README.md#keep-foreground-color))

Other Changes

- Added and updated all tests to respect the `keepForegroundColor` setting
- Refactored some functions to remove redundant code
- Added more setup and teardown code to the test suites
- Refactored tests to use arrow functions
- Refactored prepareColors function to collect the element settings using sub-functions for readability
- Created ISettingsIndexer to help indexing settings properties using enums

## 0.6.0

Features

- New setting for `peacock.elementAdjustments` that allows for slight value adjustments of affected elements to visually distinguish them from one another.
- Activity Bar icons now reflect current active state with the current activity in the foreground color and inactive activities indicated.
- Color entry now supports a larger variety of formats with more flexible entry restrictions (see [input formats](./README.md#input-formats) in [README](./README.md) for more information)

Other Changes

- Removed settings for dark and light foregrounds. Now defaults to DarkForeground = '15202b' and LightForeground = 'e7e7e7'. The value of these felt low vs the overhead of yet another setting
- Introduced the [tinycolor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinycolor2) library to handle color input validation, color conversion, and color manipulation
- Refactored much of the internal color library
- Added several unit tests for color input entry, affected elements, and element adjustments
- Updated README

## 0.5.0

Breaking Changes

Instead of an array, there are three separate configuration properties for the affected element settings:

```json
    "configuration": {
      "properties": {
        "peacock.affectTitleBar": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "default": true,
          "description": "Specifies whether Peacock should affect the title bar."
        },
        "peacock.affectActivityBar": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "default": false,
          "description": "Specifies whether Peacock should affect the activity bar."
        },
        "peacock.affectStatusBar": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "default": false,
          "description": "Specifies whether Peacock should affect the status bar."
        }
      }
    }
```

Other changes

- Refactored the constants, enums, and interfaces into a `models` folder in the code with a barrel for access

## 0.4.0

Features

- Refactored Preferred Colors to display the user-defined name of a color and the color value in a quick pick list.

The preferred colors require a custom name (`name`) and a value ( `value` ), as shown in the example below. See the README.md for details.

  "peacock.preferredColors": [
    { "name": "Gatsby Purple", "value": "#639" },
